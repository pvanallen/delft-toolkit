# Delft Toolkit
## Visual Authoring Toolkit for Smart Things

The Delft Toolkit a system for designing smart things. It incorporates machine learning and behavior trees to create smart behavior, all in a visual authoring environment.

The toolkit is currently in prototype form as a part of my research fellowship at TU Delft.

The goal of this project is to develop an authoring system approach that enables designers to easily and iteratively prototype smart things. This approach include the ability to Wizard of Oz AI behaviors and simulate physical hardware, and then migrate these simulations to working prototypes that use machine learning and real hardware.
